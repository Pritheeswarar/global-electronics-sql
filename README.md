# Global Electronics â€” SQL Analytics (Maven dataset)

Goal: reproducible SQL project answering questions on product mix, seasonality, delivery speed, and AOV by channel/region.
Architecture: one database `global_electronics` with schemas `raw` (source), `stage` (cleaned views), `marts` (analysis views).
Repo map: /sql/00_init (setup), /sql/10_inventory (profiling), /sql/20_tests (later), docs listed below.
How to run (later): we'll add exact steps after setup.
