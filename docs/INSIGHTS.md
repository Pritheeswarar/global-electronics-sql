## Anomalies & Data Caveats

**Orders but NULL delivery metrics (likely partial periods/geos)**  
(none)

**High-AOV categories vs global (≥ 2× global AOV)**  
(none)

## Reproducibility
All numbers are computed from the SQL Server marts in this project (no external sources).  
**Metric definitions:** Orders = COUNT(DISTINCT order_number); Units = SUM(quantity); Revenue_USD = SUM(line_revenue_usd); AOV_USD = Revenue / Orders; Delivery_Days = DATEDIFF(day, order_date, delivery_date); Rates as in marts.v_kpi_overview_monthly.
